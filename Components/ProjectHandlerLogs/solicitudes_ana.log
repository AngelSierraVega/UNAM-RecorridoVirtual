- Mover no los ejes, sino el modelo mismo ya que el modelo se carga siempre en las coordenadas del eje original. Ojo con la altura.
- Exportar con configuración específica. Solicitar MTL y carpeta de texturas en el OBJ. (El 15 termina mi licencia).
- Las texturas necesitan reescalarse a base 2 (128, 256, 512, 1024, etc) no nesariamente tienen que ser cuadradas.
